## Running the Code:
The working directory should have adaptive_hist_data and Histogram_Equalization folders along with the code.

**Format/Syntax:**  
		```python3 histogram_equalization.py```

## Exiting From the Code:

1. Press any key after the visualization is done. Make sure that the image window is selected while giving any key as an input.

2. You can always use ctrl+c to exit from the program.

### Note: 
Make sure that the directory tree is maintained.
Uncomment some of the lines in the code to vizualize each image.
adaptive_hist_data folder has the image dataset for processing
Histogram_Equalization folder has the resultant images after executing the pipeline.
